The `Premier League of England` and the `National Football League of France Ligue 1` and `Italy` are two of the most popular football leagues in the world. `Spain` and `Serie A`, The most games are in the `LIGA BBVA`: There are 380 matches in all. `England Premier League` (1052 goals) had the most goals scored in the 2013/2014 season, followed by Spain LIGA BBVA (1045 goals). _ Celtic, _ with only one loss in the 2013/2014 season, was the team with the fewest losses.
* Rickie Lambert * , Mario Balotelli, Xavi Hernandez, Andrea Pirlo, Paul Scholes are the most penalty scorers in the 2013/2014 season. The team that had the most won matches in 2013/14 is `Juventus` which won 33 games.
